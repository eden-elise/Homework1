# SWE Opinion Piece Reading

This weekend, we read the article ["Programmers: Stop Calling Yourselves Engineers"](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/programmers-should-not-call-themselves-engineers/414271/) by Ian Bogost.

My initial reaction to this article was feeling a bit shocked, as I had not heard this perspective before.  In the following paragraphs, I will outline where I agree with Bogost, followed by my hesitations and rejections.

## Points I Support

In the article, Bogost mentions the importance of degrees and certifications for many branches of engineering.
He explains how these 'typical' engineers are often required to have licenses, take exams, and work under advisors because the consequences of failure in those engineering fields can cause real harm.
> “Licensing processes vary by state, but Professional Engineers generally need to hold a 4-year degree from an accredited program in their discipline, pass one or more exams, and possess 4 or more years of professional experience under the supervision of a licensed engineer.”
> — *Ian Bogost*

Software engineering, however, often doesn't have the same standards.
I agree that the lack of certification fosters a grey area in accountability, as not all software engineers may have the same training.
Software systems failing can be just as dangerous as a bridge falling, and thus, software engineers should be held to the same standards as other branches of engineering.

## Hesitations about his article
1. Bogost compares failures in software with dangers in more concrete structures such as bridges and missile defense systems.
   In this section of the article, it seems unfair that he is picking and choosing failures to compare.
   Unlike structural catastrophes, many software defects are reversible and non-fatal, eg, being stuck in a company elevator or your car not starting.
   Society has evolved to a point where certain engineering flaws are tolerated (recalls, outages, accidents); shouldn't we judge software failures in the same manner?
   In my view, every field of engineering carries risk; so long as those risks are managed, edge cases anticipated, and remedies in place, we should judge them by the same standard.

2. Further, after researching Ian Bogost, I found that he is not a licensed engineer or an SWE.
   His degrees are in comparative literature, and his career is centered on authorship, video game design, and teaching at the university.
   While his perspective is still valuable, I believe it also does not have the most credibility because he doesn't directly work in either industry.
   He is speaking with criticism on top, yet does not have the practical experience of being an engineer or SWE.

### **Conclusion:**
What I’ve taken from this article is that I agree software engineering should have a more uniform path, including standardized, clearer certification.
Bogost’s push in this direction helps, but his examples feel selective and a bit overly critical.
Moreover, he writes from outside the field, so I’m cautious about how much weight to give his insights.
I support stronger accountability where the stakes are high, without painting all software work with the same brush.
