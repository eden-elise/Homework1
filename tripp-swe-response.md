# SWE Opinion Piece Reading

This weekend we read the article ["Programmers: Stop Calling Yourselves Engineers"](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/programmers-should-not-call-themselves-engineers/414271/) by Ian Bogost. 

My initial reaction to this article was feeling a bit shocked as I have not heard this perspective before.  In the following few paragraphs I will cover where I agree with Bogost and follow with my hesitations and rejections. 

## Points I Support

In the article Bogost mentions the importance of degrees and certifications for many branches of engineering.  He explains how these 'typical' engineers are often required to have licenses, take exams, and work under advisors because the consequences of failure in those engineering fields cause real harm.     
> “Licensing processes vary by state, but Professional Engineers generally need to hold a 4-year degree from an accredited program in their discipline, pass one or more exams, and possess 4 or more years of professional experience under the supervision of a licensed engineer.”
> — *Ian Bogost*

Software engineering, however, often doesn't have the same standards.  I agree with in that lack of certification fosters a weary accountability black hole in that not all software engineers may have the same training.  Software systems failing can be just as dangerous as a bridge falling and thus software engineers must be held to the same standards as the other branches of engineers.

## Hesitations about his article
1. Bogost compares failures in software with dangers in more concrete structures such as bridges and missile defense systems.  In this section of the article it seems unfair that he is picking and choosing failures to compare. Unlike structural catastrophes, many software defects are reversible and non-fatal, eg. being stuck in a company elevator or your car not starting.   Society has evolved to a point where certain engineering flaws are tolerated (recalls, outages, accidents) shouldn't we judge software failures in the same manner? In my view, every field of engineering carries risk; so long as those risks are managed, edge cases anticipated, and remedies in place, we should judge them by the same standard.
